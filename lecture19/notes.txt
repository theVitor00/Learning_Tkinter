GRID

Like with Pack, the grid only determines how much space a widget CAN occupy.

Sitcky determines what are WILL be filled.

    sticky = "n" 
    > Widget retains size but sticks at the top

    sticky = "ns"
    > Widget retains width but height is heigth of the cell

    sticky = "nswe"
    > Widget ocuppy the whole area of the cell
