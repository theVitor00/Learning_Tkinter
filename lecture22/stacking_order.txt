STACKING ORDER

    Widgets are always placed on top of other widgets when they are
    created (not when they are placed). The last widget created stays on top of the stack.

    Although you can raise widgets to be on top of all widgets or of another widget.

    widget.lift() // widget.tkraise() - Elevate the label to the upper stacking order
    widget.lower() - Puts the label to the bottom of the stacking order

    ** tkraise() can take one argument, called 'aboveThis'.
    While lift() elevates the widget all the way to the top, 
    tkraise(aboveThis = "thisWidget") elevates the widget for just one layer,
    which is one level above it.
