    > Widgets are olaced by specifying the LEFT, TOP, WIDH AND HEIGHT
    > These numbers can be absulute or relative (Percentage)

    .place(posx, posy, width(optional), height(optional)) -- absolute position
    .place(relx, rely, rel_width(optional), rel_height(optional))  -- relative position

    NOTE: On relative position, the scale of the number from 0 to 1, where 1 represents 100% of the total resolution (x and y).
    In this model for example, 0.5 represents 50%, 0.3 represents 30% and so on...

    The anchor controls which point is placed(n - north, e - east, s - south, w - west), and "center" as well
